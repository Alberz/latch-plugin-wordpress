### INSTALLING THE MODULE IN WORDPRESS ###

1. Once the administrator has downloaded the plugin, it has to be added as a module in its administration panel in WordPress. Click on "Plugins" and "Add new". It will show a form where you can browse and select previously downloaded ZIP file.

2. Go to "Latch settings", inside "Settings" and introduce "Application ID" and "Secret" previously generated. The administrator can now save the changes clicking on "Save". If everything is ok, a confirmation message will be received.

3. From now on, on user's profile, a new textbox will appear, inside "Profile" menu, where the token generated from the app should be introduced.
